# Vulnerability Detection via Topological Analysis of Attention Maps

Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches to vulnerability detection have gained significant traction. These methods demonstrate promising results, often surpassing traditional static code analysis tools in effectiveness.

In this study, we explore a novel approach to vulnerability detection utilizing the tools from topological data analysis (TDA) on the attention matrices of the BERT model. Our findings reveal that traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, when trained on the topological features extracted from these attention matrices, can perform competitively with pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as CodeBERTa. This suggests that TDA tools, including persistent homology, are capable of effectively capturing semantic information critical for identifying vulnerabilities.
