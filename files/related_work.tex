This work resembles \cite{kushnareva_artificial_2021} and uses its techniques for the vulnerability detection task. This work is an attempt to apply TDA methods over the transformer modelâ€™s attention maps and interpret topological features for the NLP field. This is the first work applying TDA methods for the vulnerability detection task.

Another works on vulnerability detection via LLMs and GNNs.

By our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages the methods from topological data analysis
in the vulnerability detection task.
