For each code sample, we calculate the persistent homology in dimension $0$ and $1$, obtaining 
the persistence diagram on each attention head of the BERT model. We compute the following 
features in each dimension from the diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The mean lifespan of points on the diagram
    \item The variance lifespan of points on the diagram
    \item The max lifespan of points on the diagram
    \item The overall number of points on the diagram
    \item The persistence entropy
\end{itemize}
